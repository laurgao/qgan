# QGANs
I am attempting to build a quantum generative adversial network to generate 2-qubit states.

My working notes from attempting to build this: [https://postulate.us/@laura/quantum](https://postulate.us/@laura/quantum)

Note to self: observe people's repos and make this repo look nice - someday. Now, my focus is on building the QGAN rather than presentation.

Also: make my notebooks nice and explain what's going on - if not for others' sake, for your future self's.
